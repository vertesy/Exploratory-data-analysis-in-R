## Preparation for the Exploratory data analysis in R course



Dear Students,

our course Exploratory data analysis in R course, will start soon 9 and 10/July.



#### Quick Summary:

1. Help me to tailor the course to your needs so fill out  [this questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/BIVreu67GH9T7r5I2).
2. Join the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/r-2018-accra) for future email communication (email invite has been sent to you).
3. Let me know if you have some wishes, or you cannot attend.
4. Check below if you are scheduled for A or B course.



#### Longer read:

I will be the only teacher and your background and experience seem very diverse, therefore I will need some assistance from your side:


1. **You will work in pairs**: 1 (more) experienced + 1 less / inexperienced student. Proposed order is below, you can change this during the course
2. **Please read to prepare:**
   1. http://bit.ly/Readings_R_DATA_ANALYSIS
   2. The basics of R: http://www.dartistics.com/basics-base_r.html
3. **Think what you want to learn from this course!**  Write it down, and **let me know in [the questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/BIVreu67GH9T7r5I2). **
4. **Install R + Rstudio** on your laptop:
   1. http://www.dartistics.com/gettingstarted.html
   2. If you don't have one, please let me know, we will try to solve it:  summer.course.2018.accra@gmail.com
5. **Prepare your data** that you want to analyse or visualise. It is best if you have a concrete dataset that you want to work on. We will try to address all of these during the course.
   1. Save it as an excel file (ideally as .csv, .tsv, .txt).
   2. You can rename measurements to 'proteinA' etc, if you are worried for your original findings. Without annotation, the data is totally safe (because its useless for others). 
   3. See a toy example in that I [uploaded on google drive, in the subfolder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13GXaMqtFHQoNi-6Oc_w3Bxi6JHrt63yU?usp=sharing): `00.Abel.Vertesy.Example`. The `.tsv` stands for tab-separated-value, it is essentially a clean, but primitive excel file. You can open it with excel or any text editor. You will upload your during the course.
6. **Try out R, especially, if you never programmed:**
   1. Write your first *script* after installing (recommended) or online: https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-r-online.  See reading for details!

### Write your first R script

A **script** is text file, that has a sequence of R ***commands*** below each other. Each command executing one task. "Running" the entire script executes all the commands in order.

1. Open Rstudio, create a new R script (Menu: File/New file/R script)

2. Save a script  as `yourscript.R` 

3. Start writing

   1. Define variables & basic operations:

      ```R
      x = 10
      y = 2
      x*y
      z = x*y
      ```

   2. Vectors, basic plots

      ```R
      # A vector is a list of single elements, and created by the c() function
      myvector = c(x,y,x)
      
      # A vector can also created as a sequence of numbers
      1:10
      my.new.vector = 1:10
      
      # create barplot
      barplot(my.new.vector)
      ```
