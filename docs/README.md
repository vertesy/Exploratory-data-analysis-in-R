## About the course

In this course we will learn about some basic concepts is data analysis and will learn how to make simple analyses in R. We will focus on practical programming skills in R to visualize and analyze various data sets. We will work a lot with visualization, both for exploring larger datasets and making figures. I encourage to take a look to some of the excellent online resources in advance! You can learn about the R programming language and editor at Rstudio [here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dromney/online-resources-learning-r) and [here](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/#r-programming).
